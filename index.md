Our goal is to impact population health by leading high-quality, consequential research at the intersection of epidemiology and precision medicine. 
We specialize in the integrative analyses of multi-omics, genetics/genomics, questionnaire, and/or EHR data to: 

1) provide insight into disease development and progression, 

2) improve secondary prevention through early detection of disease or identification of high-risk groups, and 

3) enable precision prevention. We accomplish our work using open-source software implemented in high-performance and cloud computational spaces, and with a particular focus on autoimmune and allergic diseases.
