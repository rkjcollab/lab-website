Kirk is an epidemiologist and doctoral trainee within the RKJcollab under the mentorship of Drs. Randi Johnson and Jill Norris. He earned his BA in Integrative Physiology from the University of Colorado – Boulder and his MPH from the Colorado School of Public Health, with his capstone examining heat-related injuries among agricultural workers in Guatemala. Currently pursuing a PhD in epidemiology, his research focuses on air pollution exposure, epigenetics, type 1 diabetes, and machine learning. His background includes clinical research with pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, clinical trial informatics within the Cancer Center and Clinical Trial Administration Office at the University of Colorado – Anschutz Medical Campus, and environmental epidemiology at National Jewish Health studying dust storm detection methods in collaboration with Emory University. Within the RKJcollab, he investigates immune cell profile dynamics through DNA methylation-based cell deconvolution among children genetically at risk for type 1 diabetes using the DAISY and TEDDY cohorts.
Fueled by black coffee (350-475 ml) and sunlight (20-30 min), he thrives in cool, dry spaces surrounded by good company and the sounds of film scores, rock, jazz, or electronic music. When not running, rock-climbing, or snowboarding, he’s solving puzzles, reading, or dominating in board and video games—always ready with a cocktail and a clear stance on carbs (bread comes first).
