Shane is a statistician and epidemiologist in training with a strong foundation in quantitative sciences. He earned his BA in Mathematics from Trinity University in San Antonio and an MS in Statistics from the University of Colorado, Denver. Shane worked in the RKJcollab throughout his masters, funded by the NIH’s Pathways in Genomic Data Science Fellowship. His research focuses on genetic interactions underlying autoimmune diseases, with recent projects exploring epistasis in type 1 diabetes. Currently, he is interested in causal inference and integrating multi-omic data using tools from information theory and network science to gain deeper insights into immune dysregulation and disease risk.

**Fun Facts About Shane:**
Outside the lab, he enjoys making soap, playing music, slinging pizza, and hiking. He thrives in workspaces filled with natural light, a steady supply of coffee (2 ± 1 cups), and soft Lofi or lyric-free music in the background. When ranking staple starches, he confidently goes with bread > rice > pasta > potatoes > corn > beans. Lab members describe him as the person most likely to spark a yard game or gather everyone around a game table at a party, and if he were a plot, he’d be a chord diagram - naturally connecting people, music, and ideas. In meetings, he’s known for giving a clear agenda in advance, and his coffee order of choice is a Rook Iced New Orleans.
