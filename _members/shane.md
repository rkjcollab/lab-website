Shane is a statistician and epidemiologist in training with a strong foundation in quantitative sciences. He earned his BA in Mathematics from Trinity University in San Antonio and an MS in Statistics from the University of Colorado,Denver. Shane worked in the RKJCollab throughout his masters, funded by the NIH's Pathways in Genomic Data Science Fellowship. His research focuses on genetic interactions underlying autoimmune diseases, with recent projects exploring epistasis in type 1 diabetes. Currently,he is interested in integrating multi-omic data using tools from information theory and network science to gain deeper insights into immune dysregulation and disease risk.

Outside of research, Shane enjoys making soap, playing music, slinging pizza, and hiking. His ideal working environment includes plenty of natural light, a steady supply of coffee (2 cups Â± 1), and Lofi or lyric-free music in the background. If forced to rank staple carbs, heâ€™d go with: bread > rice > pasta > potatoes > corn > beans.
