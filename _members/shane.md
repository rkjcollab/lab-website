**Fun Facts About Shane**

Outside the lab, Shane enjoys making soap, playing music, slinging pizza, and hiking.

His ideal workspace includes lots of natural light, 2 ± 1 cups of coffee, and Lofi/lyric-free music playing softly in the background.

If required to rank staple carbs, his list is: bread > rice > pasta > potatoes > corn > beans.

Lab mates say he’s the one most likely to start a yard game or gather people around a game table at a party.

If Shane were a plot, he’d be a chord diagram—a natural connector with many musical and social “networks.”

For meetings, he appreciates agendas sent in advance.
