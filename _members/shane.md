**Fun Facts About Shane**

Outside the lab, Shane enjoys making soap, playing music, slinging pizza, and hiking. He thrives in workspaces filled with natural light, a steady supply of coffee (2 ± 1 cups), and soft Lofi or lyric-free music in the background. When ranking staple carbs, he confidently goes with bread > rice > pasta > potatoes > corn > beans. Lab members describe him as the person most likely to spark a yard game or gather everyone around a game table at a party, and if he were a plot, he’d be a chord diagram—naturally connecting people, music, and ideas. For meetings, he appreciates receiving an agenda ahead of time, and his coffee order of choice is a Rook Iced New Orleans.
