Slack is a bioinformatics analyst supporting multi-omics data analysis and reproducible pipeline development, primarily for investigating the development of type 1 diabetes. Within the RKJcollab, she enjoys serving as a resource for high-performance computing and version-controlled analysis. Sarah's background includes both wet lab and computatioanl research at the Broad Institute and in Brazil through a Fulbright grant. She is currently working on an MS in computer science. 

Known for her lightning sprint speed, green thumb, ski stories, and expert cocktail crafting, she thrives near a sunny window with frequent snacks, a solid lunch dessert, and a strong opinion on carb rankings (bread reigns supreme).
