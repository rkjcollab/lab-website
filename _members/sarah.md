**Fun Facts About Sarah:**
Known for her lightning sprint speed, green thumb, ski stories, and expert cocktail crafting, she thrives near a sunny window with frequent snacks, a dependable lunch dessert, and a firm stance on carb rankings (bread reigns supreme). Lab members describe her as the one bartending at a party - mixing drinks while sampling every dessert in sight. If she were a plot, she’d be a pie chart, naturally, because of her love for all things sweet. In meetings, she multitasks effortlessly and distills key information with precision. Her preferred beverage is a hot black tea.
